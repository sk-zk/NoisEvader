**NoisEvader** is a FOSS recreation of the bullet hell music game [Soundodger+](https://soundodger.com/plus/).

With Soundodger 2 actually happening after all, I suppose this project is not really all that interesting anymore, but I'll continue development anyway
in case I come up with something I can do with this in the future.

At the moment, the main goal is to accurately recreate level playback, including glitches / unintentional behavior such as error bullets
or decimal spawners. There is also a 30fps mode for levels that require it ("lasers" work, but flicker a lot).

(There are no levels included with this game, so you need to bring your own.)

## Features
* ðŸ¦€ FLASH IS GONE ðŸ¦€
* Replays
* Gameplay modifiers
* Linux support
* More audio formats

## Known issues
The bigger ones, anyway:
* The UI is, uh, well, it exists, I suppose.
* Exclusive fullscreen causes all sorts of problems, especially under DirectX, so Borderless is recommended.
* Soundodger+ appears to apply a seemingly random audio offset to each audio file. I don't know where that comes from
or how to compensate for it, which means you're stuck with the offset for now.
* The Linux build has no AA. This will be fixed with the next MonoGame release.
